        For the past year, I have been working as a front-end web developer
        specializing in ReactJS. This role has allowed me to delve into
        React&apos;s core features and work extensively with its ecosystem. I
        have a good grasp of Git, am familiar with Git flow and Git conventions,
        and have experience with the Scrum and Agile frameworks. I am proficient
        in English and can effectively communicate in the language, whether itâ€™s
        writing detailed reports, participating in discussions, or giving
        presentations.
